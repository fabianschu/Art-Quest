# Art-Quest
Give your next visit of the Metropolitan Museum in NYC greater aim. Art Quest will elicit your preferences and direct you to personalized highlights of works of art on display along with biographical and socio-historical context to enrich your visit.

## Motivation 
Visiting a huge museum, such as the Metropolitan, can be overwhelming for the vistor. Just like music, people like different types of art. In a big museum, chances are that you spend a lot of time walking through the halls and searching for pieces that you like. Wouldn't it be nice to have a little mobile helper to help you finding artworks that you actually like?
